# GitOps Workspace Management Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides isolated workspace management for GitOps repository generation operations. The workspace system ensures that generation operations are performed in isolated environments with support for checkpointing, rollback, and atomic file operations.

## Components

### 1. Workspace Management (`workspace.go`)

**Key Features:**
- **Isolated Environments**: Each workspace has its own directory structure completely isolated from other workspaces
- **Workspace Manager**: Centralized management of workspace lifecycle (creation, retrieval, cleanup)
- **Metadata Storage**: Arbitrary key-value metadata storage for workspace context
- **Path Operations**: Helper methods for working with workspace-relative paths
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Automatic tracking of creation and modification times

**Main Types:**
- `WorkspaceManager`: Interface for managing workspace lifecycle
- `DefaultWorkspaceManager`: Default implementation using filesystem operations
- `GitOpsWorkspace`: Represents an isolated workspace with its own directory structure

**Usage Example:**
```go
// Create workspace manager
manager := NewWorkspaceManager("/tmp/workspaces")

// Create workspace for a cluster
cfg := config.NewDefault("my-cluster")
workspace, err := manager.CreateWorkspace(ctx, cfg)

// Use workspace for operations
writer := NewAtomicWriter(workspace)
writer.WriteFileString("infrastructure/main.tf", content, 0o644)

// Cleanup when done
manager.CleanupWorkspace(ctx, workspace)
```

### 2. Checkpointing (`checkpoint.go`)

**Key Features:**
- **State Snapshots**: Capture complete workspace state at any point
- **Rollback Capability**: Restore workspace to any previous checkpoint
- **Checkpoint Management**: Create, list, retrieve, and delete checkpoints
- **File Tracking**: Automatically tracks all files in checkpoint

**Main Types:**
- `WorkspaceCheckpoint`: Represents a snapshot of workspace state

**Usage Example:**
```go
// Create checkpoint before risky operation
checkpoint, err := workspace.CreateCheckpoint("pre-deploy")

// Perform operations
writer.WriteFileString("config.yaml", newConfig, 0o644)

// If something goes wrong, restore
if err != nil {
    workspace.RestoreCheckpoint("pre-deploy")
}

// Cleanup checkpoint when no longer needed
workspace.DeleteCheckpoint("pre-deploy")
```

### 3. Atomic Operations (`atomic.go`)

**Key Features:**
- **Atomic Writes**: Files are written to temp location then moved atomically
- **Transaction Support**: Multiple operations can be committed or rolled back as a unit
- **Partial Write Prevention**: Ensures files are either fully written or not present
- **Automatic Rollback**: Transactions automatically rollback on failure

**Main Types:**
- `AtomicWriter`: Provides atomic file operations
- `Transaction`: Represents a set of operations that can be committed atomically

**Usage Example:**
```go
// Atomic single file write
writer := NewAtomicWriter(workspace)
writer.WriteFileString("config.yaml", content, 0o644)

// Transactional multi-file write
tx := NewTransaction(workspace)
tx.WriteFile("file1.txt", data1, 0o644)
tx.WriteFile("file2.txt", data2, 0o644)
tx.MkdirAll("subdir", 0o755)
tx.WriteFile("subdir/file3.txt", data3, 0o644)

// Commit all operations atomically
if err := tx.Commit(); err != nil {
    // All operations are rolled back on error
    log.Printf("Transaction failed: %v", err)
}
```

## Isolation Guarantees

The workspace system provides the following isolation guarantees:

1. **Directory Isolation**: Each workspace has its own unique directory that doesn't interfere with other workspaces
2. **File Isolation**: Files created in one workspace are not visible to other workspaces
3. **Metadata Isolation**: Workspace metadata is independent and doesn't affect other workspaces
4. **Checkpoint Isolation**: Checkpoints in one workspace don't affect other workspaces
5. **Cleanup Isolation**: Cleaning up one workspace doesn't affect other workspaces

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:

### Unit Tests (`workspace_test.go`)
- Workspace creation and properties
- Workspace isolation between multiple workspaces
- Metadata operations
- Path operations
- Cleanup operations
- Timestamp tracking
- Checkpoint creation, restoration, and deletion
- Atomic write operations
- Transaction commit and rollback

### Integration Tests (`workspace_integration_test.go`)
- Complete isolation scenario with multiple workspaces
- Realistic GitOps generation scenario
- Checkpoint restoration across generation stages
- Verification of filesystem isolation

All tests pass successfully, validating the acceptance criterion:
**"Workspace provides isolated environment for generation"**

## Performance Considerations

- **Checkpoint Storage**: Checkpoints store full copies of files, so large workspaces may consume significant disk space
- **Atomic Operations**: Atomic writes use temporary files, which adds a small overhead but ensures data integrity
- **Transaction Overhead**: Transactions create checkpoints before committing, which adds overhead for large operations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Incremental Checkpoints**: Store only file deltas instead of full copies
2. **Compression**: Compress checkpoint data to reduce disk usage
3. **Concurrent Operations**: Add support for concurrent operations within a workspace
4. **Workspace Quotas**: Implement disk space quotas for workspaces
5. **Workspace Persistence**: Support for persisting workspaces across process restarts
6. **Workspace Templates**: Pre-configured workspace templates for common scenarios

## Integration with GitOps Generation

This workspace implementation is designed to integrate with the pipeline-based GitOps generation system (Task 4.2). The generation pipeline will:

1. Create a workspace for the cluster
2. Execute generation stages within the workspace
3. Create checkpoints between stages
4. Rollback to checkpoints on stage failure
5. Cleanup workspace after successful generation

Example integration:
```go
// Create workspace
workspace, err := manager.CreateWorkspace(ctx, cfg)
defer manager.CleanupWorkspace(ctx, workspace)

// Execute stages with checkpointing
for _, stage := range stages {
    // Create checkpoint before stage
    checkpointID := fmt.Sprintf("pre-%s", stage.Name())
    workspace.CreateCheckpoint(checkpointID)
    
    // Execute stage
    if err := stage.Execute(ctx, workspace); err != nil {
        // Rollback on failure
        workspace.RestoreCheckpoint(checkpointID)
        return err
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

The workspace management implementation provides a solid foundation for isolated GitOps generation operations. It ensures that generation operations are safe, recoverable, and don't interfere with each other. The comprehensive test suite validates all functionality and demonstrates the isolation guarantees.
