/*
Package gitops provides functionality for managing GitOps templates.

This package is responsible for copying and rendering embedded templates into the target GitOps repository. It uses Go's `embed` package to include the templates in the binary.

When to use

This package is used internally by openCenter to set up the GitOps repository for a cluster. It is invoked as part of the `cluster setup` command.
