Package provision provides functionality for managing provisioning templates.

This package is responsible for parsing and managing the embedded templates used for provisioning. It uses Go's `embed` package to include the templates in the binary.

When to use

This package is used internally by other packages in openCenter, such as the `ansible` and `terraform` packages, to execute provisioning templates. It is not intended for direct use by end-users.
