// Package paths provides path resolution and management utilities with organization support.
//
// This package extracts common path operations to provide reusable, testable components
// for resolving cluster paths, managing directory structures, and handling migrations
// from legacy flat structures to organization-based hierarchies.
//
// Key interfaces:
//   - PathResolver: Resolves paths with organization support
//   - MigrationManager: Handles structure migrations
//   - PathValidator: Validates paths and names
//   - DirectoryManager: Creates and manages directories
//   - PathExpander: Expands environment variables and user paths
//
// The package supports both legacy flat directory structures and new organization-based
// hierarchies, providing migration utilities to transition between them while maintaining
// backward compatibility.
