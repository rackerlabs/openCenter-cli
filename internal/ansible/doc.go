Package ansible provides functionality for generating Ansible files.

This package is used to create Ansible inventory and configuration files from templates. It is called when the `ansible.enabled` flag is set to `true` in the cluster configuration.

When to use

This package is used internally by openCenter and is not intended for direct use by end-users. It is invoked as part of the `cluster setup` command.
