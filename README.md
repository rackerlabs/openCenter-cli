# openCenter

**openCenter** is a command-line tool that streamlines cluster bootstrapping by turning a single, declarative configuration file into a ready-to-use GitOps repository.

It is designed to standardize how teams scaffold and validate Kubernetes and OpenStack-based environments, providing a configuration-first workflow that is both user-friendly and automation-ready.

## Key Features

*   **Configuration-First**: A single, comprehensive YAML file serves as the source of truth for your entire cluster definition.
*   **GitOps by Default**: Generates a complete, version-controlled GitOps repository from embedded templates, ready to be used with tools like FluxCD or ArgoCD.
*   **Built-in Validation**: Catches common configuration errors and logical inconsistencies before you ever apply them.
*   **Interactive & Scriptable**: Offers an interactive mode to guide new users and a powerful flag-based interface for CI/CD automation.
*   **Extensible**: Designed to be extended with new commands, templates, and cloud provider logic.
*   **Test-Driven**: A full suite of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tests ensures reliability and serves as living documentation.
