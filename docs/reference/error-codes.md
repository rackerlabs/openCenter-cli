## Common Error Patterns

### Configuration Syntax Errors

**Symptoms**: YAML parsing errors, unexpected characters, indentation issues

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
openCenter cluster validate {cluster}
```

**Common Causes**:
- Incorrect YAML indentation (use spaces, not tabs)
- Missing quotes around special characters
- Unclosed brackets or braces
- Invalid field names

**Resolution**: Edit the configuration file and fix syntax errors. Use a YAML validator or linter.

---

### Missing Required Fields

**Symptoms**: E1005 errors, validation failures

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
openCenter cluster schema
openCenter cluster validate {cluster}
```

**Common Causes**:
- Incomplete configuration after `cluster init`
- Fields removed during manual editing
- Schema version mismatch

**Resolution**: Add the missing required fields. Check the schema for field requirements.

---

### Invalid Values

**Symptoms**: Validation errors, type mismatches

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
openCenter cluster validate {cluster}
```

**Common Causes**:
- Wrong data type (string instead of number)
- Value outside allowed range
- Invalid enum value
- Malformed URLs or paths

**Resolution**: Correct the field value according to the schema. Use `cluster schema` to see allowed values.

---

### Provider Authentication Failures

**Symptoms**: E5001, E5002, E5003 errors

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
openCenter cluster preflight {cluster}
```

**Common Causes**:
- Expired credentials or tokens
- Missing environment variables
- Incorrect auth URL or endpoint
- Insufficient permissions

**Resolution**:
1. Verify credentials are current
2. Check environment variables are set
3. Test provider CLI tools directly
4. Review IAM/RBAC permissions

---

### Network Connectivity Issues

**Symptoms**: E3001, E3002 errors, timeouts

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
openCenter cluster preflight {cluster}
ping {host}
curl -v {url}
```

**Common Causes**:
- Firewall blocking connections
- DNS resolution failures
- Service not running
- Wrong port or endpoint

**Resolution**:
1. Check firewall rules
2. Verify DNS resolution
3. Confirm service is running
4. Test connectivity with curl or telnet

---

### SOPS Key Problems

**Symptoms**: E1002 errors, encryption/decryption failures

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
ls -la ~/.config/openCenter/clusters/{org}/{cluster}/secrets/age/
openCenter sops keygen {cluster}
```

**Common Causes**:
- Key file not generated
- Key file deleted or moved
- Wrong key file path in configuration
- Corrupted key file

**Resolution**:
1. Generate a new key with `sops keygen`
2. Verify key file location
3. Update configuration with correct key path
4. Re-encrypt secrets with new key if needed
