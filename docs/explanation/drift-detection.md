# Infrastructure Drift Detection

**Purpose:** Explain what `opencenter cluster drift` checks today and where the support boundary stops.

## What the Command Compares

The drift workflow builds a desired infrastructure model from the cluster configuration and compares it with the provider’s live API state.

Today that means:

- **OpenStack**: servers, networks, security groups, load balancers, volumes, and floating IPs.
- **VMware**: configured VM nodes, attached networks, and datastore-backed storage expectations.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Status | Reconciliation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| OpenStack | Supported | Limited safe reconciliation for mutable items such as tags and security-group rules |
| VMware | Supported | Detection only; remediation is manual |
| Kind | Not applicable | No infrastructure drift backend |
| Baremetal | Not applicable | No infrastructure drift backend |
| AWS | Removed from GA drift registry | Not supported |

## Typical Flow

```bash
# Detect drift
opencenter cluster drift detect prod-cluster

# Filter output by severity
opencenter cluster drift detect prod-cluster --severity=critical

# Preview any supported reconciliation
opencenter cluster drift reconcile prod-cluster --dry-run
```

## VMware-Specific Behavior

VMware drift detection uses the configured vCenter metadata plus `secrets.vsphere_csi` credentials to inspect:

- the configured datacenter
- the named VM nodes
- the networks attached to those VMs
- the datastores backing those VMs

The command reports differences, but it does not mutate vSphere resources for you.

## Why Kind and Baremetal Are Different

Kind is a local lifecycle provider, not a cloud-resource backend. Baremetal relies on pre-provisioned hosts that openCenter does not create or own. In both cases, the infrastructure drift contract would be misleading, so those providers are intentionally excluded.
