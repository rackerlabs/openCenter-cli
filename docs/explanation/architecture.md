# Architecture

**Purpose:** For technical users, explains the system design and architectural decisions behind openCenter, covering components through design principles.

Understanding openCenter's architecture helps you make informed decisions about deployment, customization, and troubleshooting. This explanation covers the key architectural patterns and design choices.

## System Overview

openCenter follows a **configuration-first, GitOps-native** architecture where a single YAML file drives the entire cluster lifecycle. The system transforms declarative configuration into production infrastructure through multiple layers of abstraction.

```
Configuration File (YAML)
    ↓
Validation Engine (Schema + Business Rules)
    ↓
Template Engine (Go templates + Sprig)
    ↓
GitOps Repository (Infrastructure + Applications)
    ↓
Provisioning Layer (Terraform/Kubespray)
    ↓
Production Cluster (Kubernetes + Services)
```

## Core Components

### Configuration Manager

**Purpose:** Load, validate, and manage cluster configurations.

**Design:** The configuration manager uses a layered approach with precedence rules:

1. Command-line flags (`--set`)
2. Configuration file
3. CLI defaults
4. Built-in defaults

This allows users to override values at multiple levels while maintaining sensible defaults.

**Why this design:** Flexibility for different use cases (development vs production) while ensuring consistency through defaults.

**Evidence:** `internal/config/manager.go`, `internal/config/defaults.go`

### Validation Engine

**Purpose:** Ensure configuration correctness before deployment.

**Design:** Multi-layered validation with progressive checks:

1. **Schema Validation:** JSON schema compliance (structure, types, formats)
2. **Business Rules:** Cross-field dependencies (e.g., VRRP IP required when Octavia disabled)
3. **Provider Validation:** Provider-specific constraints (image IDs, flavors, networks)
4. **Connectivity Validation:** API reachability and credential verification (optional)

**Why this design:** Catch errors early (fail fast) with increasingly specific checks. Schema validation is fast and catches 80% of errors. Business rules catch logical inconsistencies. Provider validation catches deployment-time failures before provisioning.

**Trade-offs:** More validation means slower feedback, but prevents costly deployment failures. Connectivity validation is optional because it requires credentials and network access.

**Evidence:** `internal/config/validator.go`, `cmd/cluster_validate.go`, Session 1 A3

### Template Engine

**Purpose:** Generate infrastructure and application manifests from configuration.

**Design:** Embedded templates with Go's `text/template` and Sprig functions:

- Templates embedded in binary (`//go:embed`)
- Configuration values injected via template variables
- Sprig functions for string manipulation, encoding, etc.
- No hardcoded values in templates

**Why this design:** Templates are version-controlled with the CLI, ensuring consistency. Embedding eliminates external dependencies. Sprig provides rich template functions without custom code.

**Trade-offs:** Templates are less flexible than code but more maintainable. Changes require CLI rebuild, but this ensures tested combinations.

**Evidence:** `internal/gitops/copy.go`, `internal/util/template/`, `.kiro/steering/product.md:35`

### GitOps Repository Generator

**Purpose:** Create complete GitOps repository structure.

**Design:** Standardized directory layout with Kustomize overlays:

```
<git_dir>/
├── applications/
│   └── overlays/<cluster>/
│       ├── flux-system/          # FluxCD bootstrap
│       ├── services/              # Platform services
│       └── managed-services/      # Customer applications
└── infrastructure/
    └── clusters/<cluster>/
        ├── main.tf                # Terraform/OpenTofu
        ├── inventory/             # Kubespray Ansible
        └── kubeconfig.yaml        # Cluster access
```

**Why this design:** Separation of infrastructure (Terraform) and applications (Kubernetes manifests) allows different teams to manage different layers. Kustomize overlays enable cluster-specific customization without duplicating base manifests.

**Trade-offs:** More directories and files, but clear separation of concerns. Overlay pattern requires understanding Kustomize, but provides powerful composition.

**Evidence:** `internal/gitops/`, `.kiro/steering/structure.md:118-128`, Ecosystem.md

### SOPS Manager

**Purpose:** Manage secrets encryption with Age keys.

**Design:** Dual-encryption strategy:

1. **In Git:** SOPS Age encryption (secrets safe to commit)
2. **In Cluster:** Kubernetes encryption at rest (etcd encrypted)
3. **In Transit:** FluxCD decrypts on-the-fly during reconciliation

**Why this design:** Secrets can be version-controlled safely. FluxCD handles decryption automatically. Age keys are simpler than GPG (no key servers, no expiration by default).

**Trade-offs:** Age keys must be managed separately. Key rotation requires re-encrypting all secrets. But this is simpler than alternatives (Vault, Sealed Secrets) and works offline.

**Evidence:** `internal/sops/manager.go`, Session 1 A11, Ecosystem.md secrets management

### Dependency Injection Container

**Purpose:** Manage service dependencies and lifecycle.

**Design:** Singleton container with lazy initialization:

- Services registered as factory functions
- Dependencies resolved automatically
- Singletons initialized once
- Circular dependencies prevented

**Why this design:** Testability (mock dependencies), flexibility (swap implementations), and explicit dependencies (no global state).

**Trade-offs:** More boilerplate code, but clearer dependencies and easier testing.

**Evidence:** `internal/di/`, `cmd/root.go:48-90`

## Architectural Patterns

### Configuration as Code

**Pattern:** All cluster state defined in version-controlled YAML.

**Benefits:**
- Reproducible deployments
- Audit trail (Git history)
- Rollback capability (Git revert)
- Collaboration (pull requests)

**Constraints:**
- Configuration must be complete (no implicit state)
- Changes require validation before apply
- Secrets must be encrypted

**Evidence:** `.kiro/steering/product.md:30-35`

### GitOps Native

**Pattern:** Git as single source of truth, FluxCD reconciles desired state.

**Benefits:**
- Declarative (describe what, not how)
- Self-healing (FluxCD corrects drift)
- Auditable (all changes in Git)
- Secure (no direct cluster access needed)

**Constraints:**
- Git repository required
- FluxCD must be running
- Changes take time to reconcile (5-15 minutes)

**Evidence:** Ecosystem.md GitOps flow, `.kiro/steering/product.md:31`

### Provider Abstraction

**Pattern:** Provider-specific logic isolated in adapters.

**Benefits:**
- Add new providers without changing core
- Test providers independently
- Swap providers without rewriting

**Constraints:**
- Common interface limits provider-specific features
- Abstraction adds complexity
- Not all providers have same capabilities

**Evidence:** `internal/cloud/`, `internal/provision/`, `.kiro/steering/product.md:34`

### Layered Validation

**Pattern:** Multiple validation layers with increasing specificity.

**Benefits:**
- Fast feedback (schema validation is instant)
- Specific errors (business rules explain why)
- Prevent deployment failures (provider validation)

**Constraints:**
- More code to maintain
- Validation can be slow (connectivity checks)
- False positives possible (stale provider data)

**Evidence:** `internal/config/validator.go`, Session 1 A3

### Embedded Resources

**Pattern:** Templates and defaults embedded in binary.

**Benefits:**
- No external dependencies
- Version-locked (templates match CLI version)
- Offline capable
- Single binary distribution

**Constraints:**
- Changes require rebuild
- Binary size increases
- Cannot customize without forking

**Evidence:** `internal/gitops/embed.go`, `.kiro/steering/structure.md:95`

## Design Principles

### 1. Declarative Over Imperative

**Principle:** Describe desired state, not steps to achieve it.

**Example:** Configuration specifies "3 control plane nodes" not "create node 1, create node 2, create node 3."

**Rationale:** Declarative is idempotent (safe to re-apply), easier to understand (what not how), and enables automation (reconciliation loops).

**Evidence:** `.kiro/steering/product.md:30`

### 2. Fail Fast

**Principle:** Catch errors as early as possible.

**Example:** Schema validation before business rules before provider checks before deployment.

**Rationale:** Faster feedback loop, cheaper to fix (no infrastructure provisioned), clearer error messages (specific validation layer).

**Evidence:** `internal/config/validator.go`, Session 1 A3

### 3. Composition Over Inheritance

**Principle:** Build complex behavior from simple components.

**Example:** Kustomize overlays compose base + cluster-specific configuration rather than inheriting from base classes.

**Rationale:** More flexible (mix and match), easier to understand (explicit composition), avoids deep hierarchies.

**Evidence:** Ecosystem.md Kustomize overlay pattern, `.kiro/steering/product.md:34`

### 4. Explicit Dependencies

**Principle:** Dependencies injected, not instantiated internally.

**Example:** Validation engine receives validators as parameters, not creating them internally.

**Rationale:** Testability (mock dependencies), flexibility (swap implementations), clarity (dependencies visible in signatures).

**Evidence:** `internal/di/`, Session 1 A2

### 5. Security First

**Principle:** Secure by default, no plaintext secrets.

**Example:** SOPS encryption required for secrets, no option to disable.

**Rationale:** Prevent accidental exposure, enforce best practices, compliance requirements.

**Evidence:** `internal/sops/`, Session 1 A11, `.kiro/steering/product.md:32`

```

## Scalability Considerations

### Configuration Size

**Current:** Single YAML file (typically 500-2000 lines)

**Limits:** No hard limit, but large files are harder to manage

**Mitigation:** Use CLI defaults for common values, reference external files for large data (SSH keys, certificates)

### Cluster Count

**Current:** Organization-based directory structure supports unlimited clusters

**Limits:** Filesystem limits (millions of files)

**Mitigation:** Archive old clusters, use separate organizations for different teams

### Service Count

**Current:** 20+ services enabled by default

**Limits:** Kubernetes resource limits (pods, services, etc.)

**Mitigation:** Disable unnecessary services, use larger nodes, scale horizontally

## Extension Points

### Custom Providers

Add new infrastructure providers by implementing provider interface:

1. Create provider adapter in `internal/cloud/<provider>/`
2. Implement provisioning logic in `internal/provision/<provider>/`
3. Add provider-specific validation
4. Update schema with provider configuration

**Evidence:** `internal/cloud/`, Session 1 A5

### Custom Services

Add new platform services by:

1. Create service configuration in `internal/config/services/<service>.go`
2. Add service to defaults in `internal/config/defaults.go`
3. Create service manifests in openCenter-gitops-base
4. Update documentation

**Evidence:** `internal/config/services/`, Session 1 A5

### Custom Validators

Add new validation rules by:

1. Implement validator interface in `internal/core/validation/validators/`
2. Register validator with validation engine
3. Add tests for validator

**Evidence:** `internal/core/validation/`, Session 1 A6

### Plugins

Extend CLI with external plugins:

1. Create executable named `opencenter-<plugin>`
2. Place in PATH
3. CLI discovers and loads automatically

**Evidence:** `internal/plugins/`, `cmd/plugins.go`

## Common Misconceptions

### "openCenter is just a wrapper around Terraform"

**Reality:** openCenter orchestrates multiple tools (Terraform, Kubespray, FluxCD) and provides validation, secrets management, and GitOps scaffolding. Terraform is one component.

### "Configuration changes require cluster rebuild"

**Reality:** Most configuration changes can be applied by updating the configuration file and running `opencenter cluster setup --render`. Only provider changes (OpenStack → VMware) require rebuild.

### "GitOps means no manual changes"

**Reality:** GitOps means Git is the source of truth, but manual changes are possible (and sometimes necessary) for debugging. They'll be reverted on next reconciliation unless committed to Git.

### "All secrets must be in configuration file"

**Reality:** Secrets can be in configuration file (encrypted with SOPS) or external secret providers (planned feature). Configuration file is convenient but not required.

### "openCenter only works with OpenStack"

**Reality:** OpenStack is the default and most mature provider, and the GA infrastructure surface also includes VMware, Baremetal, and Kind. AWS-backed service integrations remain available where platform services use them, but AWS is not a GA infrastructure provider.
