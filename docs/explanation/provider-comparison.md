This document explains the different infrastructure providers supported by opencenter, their characteristics, trade-offs, and guidance for choosing the right provider for your use case.

## Overview

opencenter supports multiple infrastructure providers to accommodate different deployment scenarios, from local development to production cloud deployments. Each provider has distinct characteristics, capabilities, and operational considerations.

## Supported Providers

### OpenStack

**Primary Use Case**: Production Kubernetes clusters on OpenStack-based clouds (Rackspace, private clouds)

**Architecture**:
- Uses OpenTofu/Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Leverages Kubespray (Ansible) for Kubernetes installation
- Integrates with OpenStack services: Nova (compute), Neutron (networking), Cinder (storage), Barbican (secrets)
- Supports OpenStack Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) and Container Storage Interface (CSI)

**Key Features**:
- **Mature Integration**: Full support for OpenStack networking, storage, and load balancing
- **Barbican Secrets**: Native integration with OpenStack Barbican for secrets management
- **Flexible Networking**: Supports multiple network plugins (Calico, Cilium, Kube-OVN)
- **Production Ready**: Battle-tested for enterprise workloads
- **High Availability**: Built-in support for multi-master clusters with anti-affinity rules

**Configuration Requirements**:
```yaml
opencenter:
  infrastructure:
    provider: openstack
    cloud:
      openstack:
        auth_url: "https://identity.example.com/v3"
        region: "RegionOne"
        application_credential_id: "..."
        application_credential_secret: "..."
        tenant_name: "my-project"
```

**When to Choose OpenStack**:
- Deploying on Rackspace or private OpenStack clouds
- Need enterprise-grade storage and networking features
- Require integration with existing OpenStack infrastructure
- Want Barbican-based secrets management
- Production workloads requiring high availability

**Limitations**:
- Requires OpenStack cloud access
- More complex setup than managed Kubernetes services
- Requires understanding of OpenStack concepts (projects, networks, flavors)

- Integrates with AWS services: EC2, VPC, EBS, Route53
- Supports AWS Cloud Controller Manager and EBS CSI driver

**Key Features**:
- **AWS Native**: Deep integration with AWS services
- **Scalability**: Leverage AWS's global infrastructure
- **Managed Services**: Optional integration with EKS for control plane
- **Cost Optimization**: Support for spot instances and auto-scaling
- **DNS Integration**: Route53 for cluster DNS management

**Configuration Requirements**:
```yaml
opencenter:
  infrastructure:
    provider: aws
    cloud:
      aws:
        profile: "default"
        region: "us-east-1"
        vpc_id: "vpc-12345678"
        private_subnets: ["subnet-abc", "subnet-def"]

### Talos Linux

**Primary Use Case**: Secure, immutable Kubernetes infrastructure with minimal attack surface

**Architecture**:
- API-driven Linux distribution designed for Kubernetes
- Immutable infrastructure (no SSH, no shell access)
- Uses Pulumi for infrastructure provisioning
- Integrates with OpenStack or bare metal
- Built-in disk encryption and secure boot

**Key Features**:
- **Security First**: Minimal attack surface, no SSH access

        - id: "master-1"
          name: "master-1.example.com"
          access_ip_v4: "192.168.1.10"
      worker_nodes:
        - id: "worker-1"
          name: "worker-1.example.com"

## Provider-Specific Considerations

### OpenStack Considerations

**Networking**:
- Requires understanding of Neutron networking concepts
- Must configure floating IP pools, networks, and subnets
- Supports multiple network plugins (Calico, Cilium, Kube-OVN)

**Storage**:
- Cinder volumes for persistent storage
- Boot-from-volume support for worker nodes
- Multiple volume types (HA-Standard, HA-Performance)

**Authentication**:
- Application credentials recommended over username/password
- Supports Keystone v3 authentication
- Domain-scoped or project-scoped credentials

**Preflight Checks**:
```go
// From internal/cloud/openstack/preflight.go
func PreflightOpenStack(authURL string) []string {
    var warnings []string
    // Check presence of openstack CLI
    if _, err := exec.LookPath("openstack"); err != nil {
        warnings = append(warnings, "openstack CLI not found")
    }
    // Check auth URL configured
    if authURL == "" {
        warnings = append(warnings, "auth_url is empty")
    }
    return warnings
}
```

### AWS Considerations

**Networking**:
- Requires VPC, subnets, and security groups
- Must configure public and private subnets
- Route53 for DNS management

**IAM Permissions**:
- Requires IAM role or access keys
- Needs permissions for EC2, VPC, EBS, Route53
- Consider using IAM roles for EC2 instances

**Cost Management**:
- Monitor EC2 instance costs
- Consider spot instances for worker nodes
- Use auto-scaling to optimize costs

### Talos Considerations

**Operational Model**:
- No SSH access (by design)
- All operations via `talosctl` CLI
- API-driven configuration management

**Security Features**:
- Disk encryption with LUKS
- Barbican integration for key management
- TPM/vTPM support for secure boot
- Image verification with signatures

**Learning Curve**:
- Different debugging approach (no shell access)
- Requires understanding of Talos API
- Declarative configuration model

## Migration Between Providers

opencenter configurations are designed to be provider-agnostic where possible, but migration between providers requires careful planning:

### Configuration Portability

**Portable Elements**:
- Kubernetes version and configuration
- Service definitions (cert-manager, monitoring, etc.)
- GitOps repository structure
- SOPS-encrypted secrets

**Provider-Specific Elements**:
- Cloud provider configuration (auth, networking)
- Storage classes and persistent volumes
- Load balancer configuration
- DNS and ingress setup

### Migration Strategy

1. **Export Configuration**: Save current cluster configuration
2. **Update Provider Settings**: Modify `infrastructure.provider` and cloud-specific settings
3. **Validate Configuration**: Run `opencenter cluster validate`
4. **Test in Development**: Deploy to Kind or test environment first
5. **Migrate Workloads**: Use Velero or manual migration
6. **Update DNS**: Point DNS to new cluster
7. **Decommission Old Cluster**: After validation

---

## Conclusion

Provider selection is a critical architectural decision that impacts security, operations, cost, and capabilities. Consider your requirements carefully:

- **Production workloads**: OpenStack, AWS, or Talos
- **Development/testing**: Kind
- **Maximum security**: Talos
- **On-premises**: Bare Metal or Talos
- **Cloud-native**: OpenStack or AWS

The opencenter CLI abstracts many provider differences, but understanding each provider's characteristics helps you make informed decisions and operate clusters effectively.
