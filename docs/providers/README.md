# Infrastructure Providers

openCenter’s GA infrastructure surface is intentionally narrow:

- **OpenStack**: full infrastructure automation and the most complete production path.
- **VMware**: pre-provisioned vSphere VMs with Kubernetes and service deployment managed by openCenter.
- **Kind**: local development and CI clusters.
- **Baremetal**: pre-provisioned Linux hosts managed through the same cluster configuration model.

## Support Boundary

| Provider | Status | Recommended Use |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| OpenStack | GA | Production private cloud |
| VMware | GA | Production vSphere environments |
| Kind | GA for local/dev | Developer workstations and CI |
| Baremetal | GA | Pre-provisioned physical infrastructure |
| AWS | Planned / non-GA infrastructure provider | Not recommended for GA cluster provisioning |

## Important Notes

- Use `vmware` as the canonical provider name in new configs and docs.
- `vsphere` is still accepted when loading existing configs.
- AWS-backed service integrations stay in scope for GA features that use them, but AWS is no longer advertised as a supported cluster infrastructure provider.
- Windows worker-node content is not part of the GA support commitment.
