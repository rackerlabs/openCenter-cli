## Operational Best Practices

### Change Management
- Test changes in non-production environments first
- Use GitOps workflow for all configuration changes
- Document changes in commit messages
- Schedule maintenance windows for disruptive changes
- Maintain rollback procedures for all changes

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Monitor cluster health continuously
- Set up alerts for critical conditions
- Review metrics regularly for trends
- Maintain runbooks for common alerts
- Test alerting paths periodically

### Security
- Rotate secrets and certificates regularly
- Audit access logs periodically
- Keep security scanning up to date
- Apply security patches promptly
- Review RBAC policies regularly

### Documentation
- Keep runbooks current with actual procedures
- Document incident resolutions
- Update capacity plans quarterly
- Maintain accurate contact lists
- Review and update procedures after incidents

## Emergency Contacts

Maintain an up-to-date contact list for:
- On-call engineers
- Platform team leads
- Security team
- Network operations
- Cloud provider support
- Vendor support contacts

Store contact information in your organization's incident management system.

## Compliance and Audit

### Audit Trails
- All cluster changes tracked in GitOps repository
- SOPS encryption for sensitive data
