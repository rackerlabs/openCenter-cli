This directory contains step-by-step operational procedures for common cluster maintenance tasks. Each runbook provides a tested sequence of commands with verification steps and rollback procedures.

## What Are Runbooks?

Runbooks are operational procedures that document how to perform specific maintenance tasks on production clusters. They differ from how-to guides by including:

- Detailed prerequisites and safety checks
- Exact command sequences with expected outputs
- Verification steps after each major action
- Rollback procedures if something goes wrong
- Estimated time to complete
- Required access levels and approvals

Use runbooks when performing high-risk operations on production systems where precision matters more than understanding.

## When to Use Runbooks

Use a runbook when:

- Performing scheduled maintenance on production clusters
- Executing a procedure that requires multiple coordinated steps
- Following a change management process that requires documentation
- Training new operators on standard procedures
- Responding to incidents with known resolution paths

Do not use runbooks for:

- Learning how the system works (see explanation docs)
- Understanding design decisions (see architecture docs)
- Exploring different approaches to a problem (see how-to guides)

## Available Runbooks

### Cluster Maintenance

- **[cluster-upgrade.md](cluster-upgrade.md)** - Upgrade Kubernetes cluster to a new version
  - Covers control plane and worker node upgrades
  - Includes pre-upgrade validation and post-upgrade verification
  - Estimated time: 2-4 hours depending on cluster size

- **[node-replacement.md](node-replacement.md)** - Replace a failed or degraded cluster node
  - Covers both control plane and worker node replacement
  - Includes workload migration and data preservation
  - Estimated time: 30-60 minutes per node

### Certificate Management

- **[certificate-renewal.md](certificate-renewal.md)** - Renew cluster certificates before expiration
  - Covers Kubernetes API certificates and etcd certificates
  - Includes validation and service restart procedures
  - Estimated time: 30-45 minutes

## Runbook Structure

Each runbook follows a standard format:

### 1. Overview
Brief description of what the procedure accomplishes and when to use it.

### 2. Prerequisites
- Required access levels and credentials
- Tools and versions needed
- Cluster state requirements
- Approval or change control requirements
- Backup verification

### 3. Pre-Flight Checks
Commands to verify the cluster is ready for the procedure. If any check fails, stop and investigate.

### 4. Procedure Steps
Numbered steps with exact commands, expected outputs, and verification after each major action. Steps are designed to be followed in order without deviation.

### 5. Verification
Commands to confirm the procedure completed successfully and the cluster is healthy.

### 6. Rollback Procedure
Steps to reverse the changes if something goes wrong. Includes decision points for when to rollback versus continue.

### 7. Post-Procedure Tasks
Documentation updates, notifications, and cleanup tasks.

### 8. Troubleshooting
Common issues encountered during the procedure and their solutions.

## Using Runbooks Safely

### Before Starting

1. **Read the entire runbook** - Understand all steps before executing any commands
2. **Verify prerequisites** - Ensure all requirements are met
3. **Check maintenance window** - Confirm you have sufficient time
4. **Notify stakeholders** - Alert teams about planned maintenance
5. **Create backup** - Always backup before making changes:
   ```bash
   opencenter cluster backup create <cluster> --encrypt
   ```

### During Execution

1. **Follow steps exactly** - Do not skip or reorder steps
2. **Verify after each step** - Confirm expected results before proceeding
3. **Document deviations** - Note any unexpected behavior or changes
4. **Monitor cluster health** - Watch for alerts or degraded services
5. **Stop if uncertain** - Escalate rather than guess

### After Completion

1. **Run verification steps** - Confirm cluster health
2. **Update documentation** - Note any issues or improvements
3. **Notify stakeholders** - Confirm completion and status
4. **Review and improve** - Update runbook based on experience

## Rollback Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to decide whether to rollback or continue when issues occur:

| Severity | Impact | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Critical | Service outage | Rollback immediately |
| High | Degraded performance | Rollback if not resolved in 10 minutes |
| Medium | Non-critical errors | Continue with caution, monitor closely |
| Low | Cosmetic issues | Continue, document for later fix |

## Runbook Maintenance

### Updating Runbooks

Runbooks should be updated when:

- Commands or procedures change due to software updates
- New failure modes are discovered
- Verification steps prove insufficient
- Rollback procedures are tested and refined
- Timing estimates need adjustment

### Testing Runbooks

Test runbooks regularly in non-production environments:

- **Monthly**: Execute runbooks in staging environment
- **Quarterly**: Full disaster recovery drill including rollback
- **After updates**: Test any modified procedures before production use

### Contributing

To contribute a new runbook or improve an existing one:

1. Follow the standard runbook structure
2. Test the procedure in a non-production environment
3. Document actual timings and outputs
4. Include troubleshooting for issues encountered
5. Have the runbook reviewed by another operator
6. Submit a pull request with test results

## Emergency Contacts

For issues during runbook execution:

- **On-call Engineer**: Check PagerDuty rotation
- **Platform Team**: #platform-support Slack channel
- **Security Team**: security@example.com (for security incidents)
- **Change Management**: Submit incident ticket in ServiceNow

## Compliance and Audit

For regulated environments, runbook execution may require:

- **Change approval**: Submit change request before execution
- **Audit logging**: All commands logged to SIEM
- **Peer review**: Second operator validates each step
- **Evidence collection**: Screenshots or command output saved
- **Post-execution review**: Incident report filed within 24 hours

Refer to your organization's change management policy for specific requirements.
