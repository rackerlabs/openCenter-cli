# Renderer Contract

**Purpose:** For developers and platform engineers, defines the exact boundaries between renderer-owned and bootstrap-owned paths, supported lifecycle states, the rendering model inversion from negative-list to positive-list, and the relationship between overlay descriptors and `ServicePluginManifest`.

## 1. Renderer-Owned Paths

The descriptor-driven renderer owns the following paths within each `applications/overlays/<cluster>/` tree. These paths are created, updated, and cleaned up exclusively by the renderer.

| Path | Ownership | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kustomization.yaml` (root) | renderer | Conditionally includes `./customer-managed/fluxcd` |
| `services/` | renderer | All service subdirectories and aggregate files |
| `services/sources/` | renderer | GitRepository source manifests |
| `services/fluxcd/` | renderer | FluxCD Kustomization aggregates |
| `managed-services/` | renderer | All managed-service subdirectories and aggregates |
| `managed-services/sources/` | renderer | Managed-service source manifests |
| `managed-services/fluxcd/` | renderer | Managed-service FluxCD aggregates |
| `customer-managed/` | renderer | When `overlay_units.customer_managed.enabled` is true |
| `customer-managed/sources/` | renderer | GitRepository and optional Secret |
| `customer-managed/fluxcd/` | renderer | Customer-managed FluxCD Kustomizations |
| `.sops.yaml` | renderer | When `overlay_units.sops.enabled` is true |

## 2. Bootstrap-Owned Paths

The following paths are owned by `flux bootstrap` and are outside the descriptor renderer's scope.

| Path | Ownership | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `flux-system/` | bootstrap | Created by `flux bootstrap git` |
| `flux-system/gotk-components.yaml` | bootstrap | FluxCD toolkit components |
| `flux-system/gotk-sync.yaml` | bootstrap | FluxCD sync configuration |
| `flux-system/kustomization.yaml` | bootstrap | FluxCD self-management |

The renderer does not create, modify, or validate files under `flux-system/`. Parity tests exclude `flux-system/` from comparison.

## 3. Supported Lifecycle States

### Renderer parity state

After `RenderClusterApps` completes, the overlay tree contains all renderer-owned paths. `flux-system/` may or may not exist. The root `kustomization.yaml` references `./flux-system` unconditionally because FluxCD requires it after bootstrap.

In this state:
- renderer-owned paths are present and valid
- the overlay is not a valid standalone Kustomize target if `flux-system/` is absent
- parity tests compare renderer-owned paths only

### Bootstrap-complete state

After `flux bootstrap git` runs against the cluster, `flux-system/` exists and the full overlay is a valid Kustomize target that FluxCD can reconcile.

In this state:
- all paths (renderer-owned + bootstrap-owned) are present
- the overlay is a valid, deployable Kustomize target
- FluxCD reconciles the full tree

### Pre-bootstrap validity

A root `kustomization.yaml` that references `./flux-system` before bootstrap creates an invalid Kustomize overlay. This is an accepted intermediate state, not a bug. The renderer produces this reference because FluxCD requires it post-bootstrap.

Validation rules:
- parity tests do not validate Kustomize build-ability of the full overlay
- parity tests validate renderer-owned path completeness and content
- integration tests that validate bootstrap-complete state are separate from parity tests

## 4. Rendering Model Inversion

### Previous model (negative-list)

The convention-based renderer walked the embedded filesystem and copied everything except files matched by `shouldSkipFile`. New files added to the embedded FS appeared in output automatically.

Failure mode: "too much output" — undeclared files appear in rendered output.

### Current model (positive-list)

The descriptor-driven renderer renders only files declared in a descriptor. New files added to the embedded FS but not declared in a descriptor are silently excluded.

Failure mode: "missing output" — undeclared files silently disappear.

### Mitigation

`validateDescriptorCoverage` in `descriptor_renderer.go` walks the entire embedded FS and fails if any file has zero descriptor owners or multiple owners. This validation runs before every render operation and in CI.

This means:
- adding a file to `templates/cluster-apps-base/` without a descriptor entry causes a build failure
- removing a descriptor entry without removing the template file causes a build failure
- the positive-list failure mode (silent file drops) is caught at validation time, not at render time

## 5. Overlay Descriptors vs. ServicePluginManifest

### Overlay descriptors (authoritative for rendering topology)

Location: `internal/services/descriptors/data/*.yaml`

Overlay descriptors are the sole authority for:
- which files the renderer produces for each service
- conditional file inclusion/exclusion based on config values
- aggregate target relationships (which aggregates a service contributes to)
- renderer-owned path ownership (every embedded FS file must have exactly one descriptor owner)

### ServicePluginManifest (authoritative for service metadata)

Location: `internal/services/plugin.go`

`ServicePluginManifest` is the authority for:
- service identity (name, version, type)
- service dependencies
- service configuration schema and defaults
- service validation rules

### Relationship

These are complementary, not competing. Overlay descriptors answer "what files does the renderer produce?" while `ServicePluginManifest` answers "what is this service and how is it configured?"

The renderer does not consult `ServicePluginManifest` for file membership decisions. `ServicePluginManifest.Templates` and its `Condition` field are not used by the descriptor-driven renderer. They remain available for other purposes (documentation, tooling, future plugin systems) but do not influence rendering topology.

## 6. Rollback Mechanism

The descriptor-driven renderer is the active code path. The convention-based renderer (`shouldSkipFile` + embedded FS walk) remains in the codebase but is not called by `RenderClusterAppsAtomic`.

Rollback strategy: fix-forward or git revert. There is no runtime feature flag to switch between renderers.

Rationale: maintaining two parallel rendering paths with a runtime switch adds complexity and testing burden disproportionate to the risk. The descriptor coverage validation catches the most dangerous failure mode (missing files) at build time. Git revert provides a fast rollback path for any regression.

If operational experience reveals that git revert is insufficient, a runtime feature flag can be added as a targeted response. This is a conscious deferral, not an oversight.
