# Cluster Validate Execution Flow

This document describes the code path and validation layers used by:

```bash
opencenter cluster validate
opencenter cluster validate <cluster>
opencenter cluster validate <organization>/<cluster>
opencenter cluster validate --config-file <path>
opencenter cluster validate --validation online
opencenter cluster validate --manifests
```

Only v2 configs with `schema_version: "2.0"` are supported.

## Main Code Path

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `cmd/cluster_validate.go` | Cobra command, validation-mode resolution, active-cluster fallback, output selection. |
| `cmd/cluster_validate_manifests.go` | Alternate `--manifests` path for generated GitOps manifest checks. |
| `internal/cluster/validate_service.go` | Config path resolution, v2 loading, readiness checks, mode-gated online checks, debug config export. |
| `internal/cluster/validation_formatter.go` | Text and JSON formatting from the operator report and structured validation issues. |
| `internal/config/v2/loader.go` | Native v2 load pipeline: YAML parsing, normalization, defaults, reference resolution, schema validation. |
| `internal/config/v2/readiness.go` | Offline deployment-readiness rules for provider config, GitOps auth, and enabled-service secrets. |
| `internal/cloud/openstack/discovery.go` | Live OpenStack catalog discovery used only by online validation. |

## Command Flow

```text
opencenter cluster validate
        |
        v
cmd/cluster_validate.go
        |
        +-- if --manifests:
        |      runClusterValidateManifests(...)
        |
        +-- resolve input source:
        |      --config-file path, positional cluster, or active cluster
        |
        +-- resolve validation mode:
        |      --validation, behavior.validation, or offline default
        +-- build cluster.ValidateOptions
        |
        v
internal/cluster.ValidateService.Validate(...)
        |
        +-- resolve named cluster path, if needed
        +-- load v2 config exactly once
        +-- run offline readiness checks
        +-- run local GitOps checks
        +-- if mode is online:
        |      run provider connectivity, provider discovery, and Git remote checks
        +-- build operator report
        +-- optionally export debug config
        |
        v
format grouped text or JSON
```

The command no longer preloads named-cluster configs to discover the provider. The service owns config loading and stores the active provider on `ValidationResult.Provider`, so `--config-file` and named-cluster mode follow the same validation path.

## Config Source Resolution

`--config-file` validates the provided file directly. The service checks file existence, loads the file through the v2 loader, and reports load/schema failures as validation issues.

Named cluster mode is used when no config file is supplied. The identifier is selected in this order:

1. Positional argument, if supplied.
2. Active cluster from `OPENCENTER_CLUSTER`, shell session state, or the persistent active marker.

Identifiers can be `cluster` or `organization/cluster`.

- `organization/cluster` resolves through `PathResolver.Resolve`.
- `cluster` resolves through `PathResolver.ResolveWithFallback`, which searches organization directories.

If no positional argument and no active cluster are available, the command returns:

```text
no cluster name provided and no active cluster set
```

## Validation Layers

### 1. Native v2 Loading

`ValidateService` builds a v2 loader with the defaults registry and calls:

```go
cfg, err := loader.LoadFromFile(configPath)
```

The loader performs:

- YAML parsing with known-field enforcement.
- Schema version validation for `schema_version: "2.0"`.
- Input normalization.
- Reference resolution for supported `${ref:...}`, `${env:...}`, and `${file:...}` values.
- Defaults hydration.
- Struct tag validation through `go-playground/validator`.
- Existing v2 business rules, such as OpenTofu backend shape.

Loader errors are converted to structured issues with category `schema`.

### 2. Offline Readiness Validation

After a config loads successfully, `internal/config/v2.ValidateReadiness` runs deterministic checks that do not contact cloud APIs, Git remotes, or Kubernetes.

Each issue has:

- `severity`: `error` or `warning`
- `category`: `schema`, `provider`, `gitops`, `services`, or `connectivity`
- `path`: config path, when available
- `message`
- `suggestion`, when available

Any `error` makes `ValidationResult.Valid` false. Warnings are reported without failing validation.

#### OpenStack Offline Checks

When `opencenter.infrastructure.provider` is `openstack`, readiness validation requires:

- `opencenter.infrastructure.cloud.openstack.auth_url`
- `region`
- `project_id`
- `image_id`
- application credential ID and secret
- `network_id` or `network_name`
- master flavor when `master_count > 0`
- worker flavor when `worker_count > 0`
- Windows worker flavor when `worker_count_windows > 0`
- bastion flavor when bastion is enabled
- each additional worker-pool flavor when the pool count is greater than zero

It also:

- warns when the OpenStack auth URL uses plain HTTP
- errors on empty or `CHANGEME` OpenStack credential values
- errors when inactive provider cloud sections are present alongside OpenStack

#### GitOps Checks

`opencenter.gitops.repository.url` is required.

For HTTPS repository URLs:

- token auth must be configured
- `gitops.auth.token.token` or `gitops.auth.token.token_file` must be set
- token provider must match the repository host:
  - `github.com` requires `github`
  - GitLab hosts require `gitlab`
  - other HTTPS Git hosts require `gitea`

For SSH repository URLs:

- SSH auth must be configured
- `gitops.auth.ssh.private_key` must be set
- `gitops.auth.ssh.public_key` must be set

Configuring both SSH auth and token auth for the same repository is an error.

#### Enabled-Service Secret Checks

Only enabled services are checked. Empty strings and `CHANGEME` are treated as missing.

The v2-native secret map currently covers:

- Keycloak admin password whenever Keycloak is enabled
- Keycloak and Headlamp OIDC client secrets when OIDC is external; internal Keycloak OIDC generates them during bootstrap
- Grafana admin password when `kube-prometheus-stack` is enabled
- Loki Swift or S3 credentials when the selected storage mode requires them
- Tempo Swift or S3 credentials when the selected storage mode requires them
- cert-manager Route53 or Cloudflare DNS credentials
- Weave GitOps password or password hash
- alert-proxy account/device credentials
- vSphere CSI credentials when the vSphere CSI service or storage plugin is enabled

### 3. Online Connectivity Checks

`behavior.validation: online` or `--validation online` enables checks that can contact external systems. For OpenStack, it validates that the Keystone auth URL is syntactically valid and reachable. Server-side 5xx responses fail connectivity validation; auth-oriented responses such as 401 or method responses do not fail the URL reachability check by themselves.

Connectivity findings use category `connectivity` and set `ValidationResult.ConnectivityValid` false when they are errors.

### 4. Online Live Provider Checks

Online validation authenticates and discovers a provider catalog through `internal/cloud/openstack.DiscoveryClient` for OpenStack.

The live catalog check validates configured:

- images and image names
- master, worker, Windows worker, bastion, and worker-pool flavors
- networks and network names
- subnet IDs
- floating IP pools and external networks
- availability zones
- Designate availability when Designate is enabled

OpenStack API, auth, discovery, or missing-resource failures are returned as structured provider issues. No live provider checks run during offline validation.

## ValidationResult Fields

`ValidateService.Validate` returns `ValidationResult`.

Important fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Valid` | False when any error-severity issue exists. |
| `ConfigValid` | False for schema, GitOps, service, and other config-readiness errors. |
| `ConnectivityValid` | False for connectivity errors. |
| `ProviderValid` | False for provider config or live provider errors. |
| `Provider` | Active provider from the loaded config. |
| `SchemaVersion` | Normalized schema identifier, currently `v2`. |
| `Issues` | Structured validation findings. |
| `Errors` | Backward-compatible string errors derived from error issues. |
| `Warnings` | Backward-compatible string warnings derived from warning issues. |
| `Suggestions` | Deduplicated suggestions shown in text and JSON output. |
| `DebugConfigPath` | Path to `.opencenter-v2.yaml` when debug export is requested. |

## Output

Text output groups errors by config section and shows validation status for configuration, connectivity, and provider checks.

JSON output includes:

- `valid`
- `summary`
- `details`
- `errors`
- `errors_by_section`
- `warnings`
- `suggestions`
- `issues`
- `schema_version`
- `debug_config_path`, when generated

The formatter uses `ValidationResult.Issues` when present. It falls back to legacy string parsing for older callers that only populate `Errors`.

## Debug Config Export

When `--generate-debug-config` is passed, or `OPENCENTER_DEBUG` is set, the service exports the effective config after defaults and reference resolution:

```text
<output-dir>/.opencenter-v2.yaml
```

The export uses file mode `0600`. Export failures become warnings rather than command-level errors.

## Manifest Validation Mode

`--manifests` exits the normal config-readiness path and calls `runClusterValidateManifests`. That mode validates generated GitOps manifests rather than the cluster config itself.

Manifest validation should not be treated as a substitute for config readiness validation. Use both when checking a deployment pipeline end to end.
