# Release Process

**Purpose:** For maintainers, shows how to create and publish releases of openCenter-cli.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a release, you need:
- Maintainer access to the repository
- Git configured with commit signing
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed (optional but recommended)
- All tests passing on main branch

## Release Types

### Semantic Versioning

openCenter-cli follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major** (v2.0.0) - Breaking changes
- **Minor** (v1.1.0) - New features, backward compatible
- **Patch** (v1.0.1) - Bug fixes, backward compatible
- **Pre-release** (v1.0.0-rc1) - Release candidates

### Release Cadence

- **Major releases** - As needed for breaking changes
- **Minor releases** - Monthly or when features are ready
- **Patch releases** - As needed for critical bugs
- **Pre-releases** - Before major/minor releases for testing

## Step 1: Prepare Release

### Update CHANGELOG.md

Move unreleased changes to new version section:

```markdown
## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- AWS provider support with EC2 provisioning
- Multi-cluster management commands
- Shell integration for active cluster display

### Changed
- Improved validation error messages
- Updated default Kubernetes version to 1.33.5

### Fixed
- VRRP validation logic for OpenStack
- Template rendering for VMware provider

### Security
- Updated dependencies with security patches

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- (empty for next release)
```

### Update Version Documentation

Update version references in:
- `README.md` - Installation instructions
- `docs/tutorials/getting-started.md` - Version examples
- `docs/reference/default-values.md` - Default versions

### Run Full Test Suite

```bash
# Build
mise run build

# Run all tests
mise run test
mise run godog

# Schema verification
mise run schema-verify

# Security tests
mise run test-security

# Integration tests
mise run test-integration
```

All tests must pass before proceeding.


## Step 2: Build Release Binaries

### Build for All Platforms

```bash
# Build release binaries with version
mise run release v1.2.0
```

This creates binaries in `bin/release/`:
- `opencenter-1.2.0-linux-amd64`
- `opencenter-1.2.0-linux-arm64`
- `opencenter-1.2.0-darwin-amd64`
- `opencenter-1.2.0-darwin-arm64`

### Verify Binaries

Test each binary:

```bash
# Linux AMD64
./bin/release/opencenter-1.2.0-linux-amd64 version

# macOS ARM64
./bin/release/opencenter-1.2.0-darwin-arm64 version
```

Expected output shows correct version, commit, and build date.

### Generate Release Notes

Release notes are auto-generated:

```bash
# Generate release notes
mise run publish 1.2.0
```

Creates `bin/release/RELEASE_NOTES_1.2.0.md` with:
- Changes in this release (from git log)
- Installation instructions
- Platform support
- Known issues

Review and edit release notes as needed.

## Step 3: Create Git Tag

### Tag Release

```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release 1.2.0"

# Verify tag
git tag -l v1.2.0
git show v1.2.0
```

### Push Tag

```bash
# Push tag to origin
git push origin v1.2.0
```

This triggers CI to build and test the release.

## Step 4: Create GitHub Release

### Using GitHub CLI

```bash
# Create release with binaries
gh release create v1.2.0 \
  --repo opencenter-cloud/openCenter-cli \
  --title "opencenter 1.2.0" \
  --notes-file bin/release/RELEASE_NOTES_1.2.0.md \
  bin/release/opencenter-*
```

For pre-releases:
```bash
gh release create v1.2.0-rc1 \
  --repo opencenter-cloud/openCenter-cli \
  --title "opencenter 1.2.0-rc1" \
  --notes-file bin/release/RELEASE_NOTES_1.2.0-rc1.md \
  --prerelease \
  bin/release/opencenter-*
```

### Using GitHub Web UI

1. Navigate to https://github.com/opencenter-cloud/openCenter-cli/releases/new
2. Select tag: `v1.2.0`
3. Set title: `opencenter 1.2.0`
4. Paste release notes from `bin/release/RELEASE_NOTES_1.2.0.md`
5. Upload binaries from `bin/release/`
6. Check "Set as the latest release"
7. Click "Publish release"

## Step 5: Verify Release

### Download and Test

```bash
# Download binary
curl -L https://github.com/opencenter-cloud/openCenter-cli/releases/download/v1.2.0/opencenter-1.2.0-linux-amd64 -o opencenter

# Make executable
chmod +x opencenter

# Test
./opencenter version
./opencenter cluster init test --org test-org
```

### Check Release Page

Verify on GitHub:
- Release appears in releases list
- All binaries are attached
- Release notes are correct
- Installation instructions work

## Step 6: Announce Release

### Update Documentation

Update installation instructions:

```markdown
## Installation

Download the latest release:

**Linux (x86_64)**
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/opencenter-cloud/openCenter-cli/releases/download/v1.2.0/opencenter-1.2.0-linux-amd64 -o opencenter
chmod +x opencenter
sudo mv opencenter /usr/local/bin/
```

   gh release create v1.2.1 --notes-file bin/release/RELEASE_NOTES_1.2.1.md bin/release/opencenter-*
   ```

5. Merge hotfix back to main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge hotfix/1.2.1
   git push origin main

# Create pre-release
gh release create v1.2.0-rc1 \
  --prerelease \
  --notes "Release candidate for 1.2.0. Please test and report issues." \
  bin/release/opencenter-*
```

Test for 1-2 weeks before final release.

## Rollback

If a release has critical issues:

1. Mark release as pre-release on GitHub
2. Add warning to release notes
3. Create hotfix release
4. Update documentation to point to previous stable version

## Common Issues

### Build fails with version mismatch

**Problem:** `go.mod` version doesn't match build

**Solution:**
```bash
# Update go.mod
go mod tidy

# Rebuild
mise run build
```

### Tag already exists

**Problem:** Git tag already exists

**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v1.2.0

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.2.0

# Recreate tag
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release 1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0
```

### Release notes missing commits

**Problem:** Some commits not in release notes

**Solution:**
```bash
# Manually generate changelog
git log v1.1.0..v1.2.0 --oneline --no-merges

# Edit release notes
vim bin/release/RELEASE_NOTES_1.2.0.md
```

### Binary doesn't run on target platform

**Problem:** Binary fails with "exec format error"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify GOOS/GOARCH
file bin/release/opencenter-1.2.0-linux-amd64

# Rebuild with correct platform
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/release/opencenter-1.2.0-linux-amd64
```
