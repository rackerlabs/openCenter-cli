# Overlay Rendering Security Policy

**Purpose:** For developers and operators, defines the security policies governing customer-managed repository trust, secret handling, `.sops.yaml` generation, audit trails, and redaction in the overlay rendering pipeline.

## 1. Repository Trust Policy

### Allowed transport protocols

Customer-managed repository URLs must use one of:
- `ssh://` — required when `emit_secret` is true (SSH key authentication)
- `https://` — allowed only when `emit_secret` is false (token or public access)

The `http://` scheme is rejected by `validateOverlayUnitConfig`. No other schemes are permitted.

Enforcement: `internal/gitops/overlay_units_validation.go:validateCustomerManagedOverlay`

### Host key validation

When `emit_secret` is true and the transport is SSH, the `known_hosts` field in `secrets.overlay_units.customer_managed` must be non-empty. This value is emitted into the GitRepository Secret so that FluxCD validates the remote host key during Git operations.

The renderer does not validate the content of `known_hosts` beyond non-emptiness. Operators are responsible for providing a correct host key entry obtained through a trusted channel (e.g., `ssh-keyscan` against a verified host).

### Branch protection

The renderer does not enforce branch protection policies on customer-managed repositories. Branch protection is the responsibility of the repository owner. The `branch` field in `customer_managed` config is rendered into the FluxCD GitRepository spec without modification.

## 2. Secret Handling Model

### Source of truth

Cluster-scoped secret data for overlay units is provided via the typed config surface at `secrets.overlay_units.customer_managed` in the cluster config file (`.k8s-<cluster>-config.yaml`).

Fields:
- `identity`: SSH private key content (base64-encoded in the emitted Secret)
- `identity_pub`: SSH public key content
- `known_hosts`: SSH known hosts entry

### Delivery mechanism

Secret values are read from the cluster config file at render time. The config file itself should be:
- encrypted at rest using SOPS Age encryption
- stored in a location with appropriate access controls
- never committed to Git with plaintext secret values

The renderer reads plaintext values from the parsed config and emits them as base64-encoded Kubernetes Secret data. SOPS encryption of the emitted Secret file is handled by the `.sops.yaml` path regex rules, not by the renderer itself.

### Fixture secret policy

Repository fixtures must contain only clearly synthetic placeholder values:
- All secret fields must use the `PLACEHOLDER-` prefix
- The fixture secret scanner (`fixture_secret_test.go`) enforces this in CI
- Real credentials must never appear in fixtures, even temporarily
- If real credentials are found in fixture Git history, they must be rotated immediately

## 3. `.sops.yaml` Generation

### Security sensitivity

`.sops.yaml` controls which files SOPS encrypts and which Age recipients can decrypt them. Generating this file from config means the renderer influences encryption scope. Errors in generation can cause:
- secrets committed in plaintext (if path regex is too narrow)
- inability to decrypt secrets (if recipients are wrong)

### Validation rules

The renderer validates `.sops.yaml` generation inputs before rendering:
- at least one rule is required when SOPS is enabled
- each rule must have a non-empty `path_regex`
- each rule must have at least one non-empty `age_recipient`

Enforcement: `internal/gitops/overlay_units_validation.go:validateSOPSOverlay`

### Review expectations

Changes to `.sops.yaml` generation logic or to the `SOPSGenerationConfig` type surface should be reviewed with attention to:
- whether the path regex correctly covers all files that contain secret data
- whether the Age recipients list is correct for the target cluster
- whether the `encrypted_regex` (if set) correctly identifies secret fields within YAML files

## 4. Redaction Requirements

### Principle

Logs, test failure messages, and diagnostic output must not print secret values. This applies to:
- renderer error messages
- parity test failure output
- CI pipeline logs
- structured diagnostic output

### Current state and path forward

A `CredentialMasker` exists at `internal/security/credential_masker.go` with patterns for AWS keys, Age keys, private key blocks, passwords, tokens, and generic secrets.

The renderer and parity tests do not currently use the masker. The risk is mitigated by:
- fixture secrets using `PLACEHOLDER-` values (not real credentials)
- the fixture secret scanner rejecting real credential patterns
- config files being SOPS-encrypted at rest

Integration of the credential masker into renderer diagnostics and parity test output is tracked as a future improvement. The immediate risk is low because the renderer does not log secret field values during normal operation.

## 5. Audit Trail

### Mechanism

Changes to security-sensitive config fields are auditable through Git history of the cluster config files. The following fields are security-sensitive:

- `opencenter.gitops.overlay_units.sops.*` (encryption scope)
- `opencenter.gitops.overlay_units.customer_managed.repository_url` (trust boundary)
- `secrets.overlay_units.customer_managed.*` (credential material)

### Expectations

- Config files should be committed with meaningful commit messages that explain why security-sensitive fields changed.
- SOPS-encrypted config files provide an implicit audit trail: decryption requires the correct Age key, and key rotation is tracked by the CLI's key lifecycle commands.
- No structured audit logging beyond Git history is currently implemented. If regulatory requirements demand it, a structured audit log can be added as a separate feature.
