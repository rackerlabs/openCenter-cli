# Glossary

**Purpose:** Definitions of terms used throughout openCenter CLI documentation.

## A

**Age**
: Modern encryption tool using public-key cryptography. openCenter uses Age for SOPS encryption. Simpler than GPG with no key servers or expiration by default.

**Ansible**
: Automation tool used by Kubespray to deploy Kubernetes. openCenter generates Ansible inventory files for cluster provisioning.

**Application Credential**
: OpenStack authentication method using credential ID and secret instead of username/password. Recommended for automation.

## B

**Bootstrap**
: Process of deploying a cluster from configuration. Includes infrastructure provisioning, Kubernetes deployment, and GitOps setup.

**BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)**
: Testing methodology using Gherkin scenarios. openCenter uses Godog for BDD tests in `tests/features/`.

## C

**Calico**
: Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin for Kubernetes networking. Default CNI in openCenter.

**CNI (Container Network Interface)**
: Standard for configuring network interfaces in Linux containers. Kubernetes uses CNI plugins like Calico, Cilium, or Flannel.

**Cobra**
: Go library for building CLI applications. openCenter uses Cobra for command structure and flag parsing.

**Control Plane**
: Kubernetes components that manage the cluster (API server, scheduler, controller manager, etcd). openCenter deploys 3 control plane nodes for high availability.

## D

**Diátaxis**
: Documentation framework organizing content into four types: Tutorials, How-To Guides, Reference, and Explanation. openCenter documentation follows Diátaxis.

**Drift Detection**
: Process of identifying differences between desired configuration (Git) and actual cluster state. openCenter provides drift detection commands.

## F

**FluxCD**
: GitOps tool that continuously reconciles cluster state with Git repository. openCenter generates FluxCD manifests for GitOps management.

**Flavor**
: OpenStack term for VM size (CPU, RAM, disk). Similar to AWS instance types or VMware VM templates.

## G

**GitOps**
: Operational model where Git is the single source of truth for infrastructure and applications. Changes are made via Git commits, not direct cluster access.

**Godog**
: Go implementation of Cucumber for BDD testing. openCenter uses Godog for feature tests.

## H

**HelmRelease**
: FluxCD custom resource that deploys Helm charts. openCenter generates HelmRelease manifests for platform services.

## K

**Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)**
: Tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers. Used for development and testing.

**Kubespray**
: Ansible playbooks for deploying production-ready Kubernetes clusters. openCenter uses Kubespray for cluster provisioning.

**Kustomize**
: Kubernetes configuration management tool using overlays. openCenter uses Kustomize for cluster-specific customization.

**Kustomization**
: FluxCD custom resource that applies Kustomize overlays. openCenter generates Kustomization manifests for services.

## M

**Mise**
: Tool version manager and task runner. openCenter uses Mise for managing Go, kubectl, kind, helm versions and build tasks.

## O

**Octavia**
: OpenStack load balancer service. When disabled, openCenter uses VRRP for control plane high availability.

**OpenTofu**
: Open-source Terraform fork. openCenter supports both Terraform and OpenTofu for infrastructure provisioning.

**Overlay**
: Kustomize pattern for customizing base manifests. openCenter uses overlays for cluster-specific configuration.

## P

**Pod Security Admission**
: Kubernetes admission controller enforcing security policies on pods. openCenter configures Pod Security Admission via Kubespray.

**Preflight Check**
: Validation performed before deployment to catch issues early. openCenter provides preflight commands for connectivity, quotas, and provider constraints.

**Provider**
: Infrastructure platform for cluster deployment. openCenter’s GA infrastructure providers are OpenStack, VMware, Baremetal, and Kind.

## S

**SOPS (Secrets OPerationS)**
: Tool for encrypting files with Age or GPG keys. openCenter uses SOPS for secrets management in Git.

**Sprig**
: Template function library for Go templates. openCenter uses Sprig functions in templates for string manipulation, encoding, etc.

## T

**Terraform**
: Infrastructure as Code tool for provisioning cloud resources. openCenter generates Terraform configurations for cluster infrastructure.

## V

**VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)**
: Protocol for high availability of network gateways. openCenter uses VRRP for control plane HA when Octavia is disabled.

**vSphere**
: VMware virtualization platform. openCenter supports deploying clusters on vSphere with pre-provisioned VMs.

## W

**Worker Node**
: Kubernetes node that runs application workloads. openCenter deploys 2+ worker nodes by default.
