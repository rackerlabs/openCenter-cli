// newClusterCredentialsCmd creates the top-level "cluster credentials" command.
// It has subcommands for export and unset operations.
// Note: This command is now superseded by 'cluster select --activate' but kept for backward compatibility.

This command provides subcommands for exporting and unsetting cloud provider
credentials that are stored in the cluster's SOPS-encrypted configuration.

Note: This command is superseded by 'cluster select --activate' which provides
the same functionality with a simpler interface.

Supported providers:
  • aws - Amazon Web Services credentials
  • openstack - OpenStack application credentials
  • all - All configured providers

The credentials are sourced from the cluster configuration file and can be
exported in various formats for use with other tools or unset from the
current environment.

Configuration sources:
  • AWS: opencenter.infrastructure.cloud.aws and secrets.global.aws.infrastructure
  • OpenStack: opencenter.infrastructure.cloud.openstack

Common workflow:
  1. Export credentials to environment variables
  2. Use with other cloud tools (terraform, ansible, etc.)
  3. Unset credentials when done`,
		Example: `  # Export AWS credentials for current cluster
  eval $(opencenter cluster credentials export --provider aws)

  # Export OpenStack credentials for specific cluster
  eval $(opencenter cluster credentials export my-cluster --provider openstack)

  # Export all credentials in JSON format
  opencenter cluster credentials export --provider all --format json

  # Clear AWS credentials from environment
  eval $(opencenter cluster credentials unset --provider aws)

  # Clear all credentials from environment
  eval $(opencenter cluster credentials unset --provider all)`,
		RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
			return cmd.Help()
		},
	}

	// Add subcommands
	cmd.AddCommand(newClusterCredentialsExportCmd())
	cmd.AddCommand(newClusterCredentialsUnsetCmd())

	return cmd
}
